Data structure:
It is the way of organizing the data items and establishing the relationship between them so that they can make a program more effective for execution of the program.It is systematic way to organize data in order to use it efficiently.
To develop the program,we should select the appropriste data structure for that program.Therefore , algorithum and its associated data structures form a program.

A static data structure is one whose capacity is fixed at creation. For example:array is one example of the static data structure.
best Algorithum + best data structure = best progrma

A dynamic data structure is one whose capacistey is variable,so it can expand or contract at any time. For example:linked list, binary tree etc

1.Classification of the data structure:
a. Primitive data structure: 
         integer, float,character,pointer
b.Non-Primitive data structure:
         It is further divided into two types:
         1. linear and 2. Non-linear
b.1.1:linear:
1-->generalizing indexing: 
             Dictionary and hash table:
2-->Direct Access:
        Array(sorted and unsorted), record, file
3-->Sequentail Access:
       List(linked representation and sequential Representaion)
       Stack
       Queue
       Priority Queue
Nonlinear data structure:
1.Hierarchical:(Tree and Heap)
2.Group(set and Graph)



@Algorithum:
 An algorithum is well defined procedure that allows a computer to solve a problem or step by step procedure of solving the problem.
 Diffrent types of algorithums:
 Recursive algorithums
 Dynamic programming algorithum
 Backtracking algorithm
 Greedy algorithm and many more.
 From data structure point of view , follwing are some imp categories of algorithms:
 search: Algorithm to search an items in data structure
 sort- Algorithm to sort items in a  certain order 
 Insert -Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.
 Delete-Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.
